3. Write a PySpark code to read a JSON file named "students.json" containing student records with the following schema: "name" (string), "age" (integer), "grade" (string). Filter the DataFrame to include only students whose age is greater than 18.

Solution:

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Create a SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Filter Students").getOrCreate()

# Read the JSON file into a DataFrame
df = spark.read.json("students.json")

# Filter the DataFrame to include only students whose age is greater than 18
filtered_df = df.filter(col("age") > 18)

# Display the filtered DataFrame
filtered_df.show()
